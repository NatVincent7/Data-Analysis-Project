Superstore Sales Analysis and Forecasting
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a retail superstore and forecasting future sales using advanced data analysis and time series forecasting techniques. The goal is to explore the key drivers of sales, identify trends and seasonality, and develop a predictive model to forecast future sales performance.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a detailed investigation of the dataset, including identifying top-selling products, sales by category, and sales trends over time.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, convert date columns, and derive new columns for better analysis.
Time Series Analysis: Decompose the sales data into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
Forecasting: Use a SARIMAX model to forecast future sales.
Tools and Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Plotly: For interactive charts and graphs.
Statsmodels: For time series analysis and forecasting using SARIMAX.
SQLite: Used for storing cleaned data and performing SQL queries.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the "Superstore Sales.csv", which contains sales information for a retail superstore. The dataset includes the following columns:

Order Date: Date when the order was placed.
Ship Date: Date when the order was shipped.
Product Name: Name of the product sold.
Sales: Revenue generated from the sale.
Category: Product category.
Postal Code: Customer's postal code.
Analysis and Results
1. Top 10 Selling Products by Revenue
A pie chart displaying the top 10 products that contribute the most to the overall sales.

2. Revenue Distribution by Category
A pie chart showing how sales are distributed among different product categories.

3. Monthly Sales Trend
A line plot illustrating the monthly sales trend over time to identify patterns, seasonality, and overall growth or decline.

4. Seasonal Decomposition
The sales data is decomposed into its trend, seasonal, and residual components to better understand the underlying patterns.

5. Sales Forecasting
Using the SARIMAX model, future sales are forecasted for the next 12 months, providing insights into expected sales performance.
